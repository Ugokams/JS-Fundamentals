📘 JS-Fundamentals

This repository contains basic JavaScript exercises focused on understanding fundamental programming concepts, such as variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and handling command-line arguments in Node.js.

Each script demonstrates a specific concept and can be executed using the Node.js runtime.

🛠️ Requirements

Node.js (v14 or higher recommended)

All files should end with a new line.

All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Node.js.

You are not allowed to use var — use const or let instead.

Use console.log(...) to print output.

🚀 How to Run

Clone the repository and navigate into the folder:

git clone https://github.com/Ugokams/JS-Fundamentals.git
cd JS-Fundamentals


Run any file using Node:

node filename.js


Example:

node 0-javascript_is_amazing.js

📂 Files and Descriptions
File	Description
0-javascript_is_amazing.js	Declares a constant myVar with the value "JavaScript is amazing" and prints it.

2-arguments.js	
Prints a message based on the number of arguments passed.

3-value_argument.js	Prints the first argument passed to the script, or "No argument" if none.

4-concat.js	Prints two arguments in the format: <arg1> is <arg2>.

5-to_integer.js	Converts the first argument to an integer and prints it, or "Not a number".

6-multi_languages_loop.js	Prints three lines using an array and a loop.

7-multi_c.js	Prints "C is fun" x times, where x is the first argument.

8-square.js	Prints a square made of 'X' characters of a given size.

9-add.js	Defines a function add(a, b) and prints the sum of two integers.
